**Dataset:** S0603-M3-Rose_Garden-UTM16N-1m  
**Author:** Marco Accardi

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the feature extraction results from the Rose Garden digital elevation model (DEM). The extraction process generated multiple feature categories including terrain, texture, spectral, and hydrological characteristics. These features capture different aspects of the landscape's morphology, surface patterns, frequency characteristics, and water flow dynamics. The analysis reveals a complex terrain with varied elevation patterns, distinctive textural properties, and well-defined drainage networks.

## 1. Data Structure and Organization

### 1.1 Overview of Result Files

The feature extraction process generated four primary categories of features, each stored in separate CSV files with accompanying JSON metadata:

1. **Terrain Features** - Basic topographic characteristics
2. **Texture Features** - Surface pattern and texture metrics
3. **Spectral Features** - Frequency domain characteristics
4. **Hydrological Features** - Water flow and drainage metrics

Each feature category is organized in a consistent structure with spatial coordinates, elevation data, and category-specific metrics.

### 1.2 File Structure

#### CSV Files
All CSV files follow a similar structure with the following common columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each cell
- `x`, `y`: Spatial coordinates
- `elevation`: Elevation value in meters
- Category-specific feature columns

#### JSON Metadata Files
The JSON files provide important metadata including:
- Input/output file information
- Raster dimensions and statistics
- Processing time and parameters
- Feature statistics (min, max, mean, etc.)
- Feature descriptions and units

## 2. Feature Categories and Metrics
